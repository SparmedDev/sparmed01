<p><strong>{% trans "IN CASE OF RETURN" %}</strong></p>
<p>
  {% blocktrans %}
  After SparMED communicates its acceptance of a case the customer has 5 working days to arrange the dispatch of goods. (See Return goods instructions)</br>
  All products must be in the same condition as when shipped out from SparMED. Pictures will be taken in advance for the purpose of traceability and as proof of the order(s) status when leaving SparMED’s warehouse.</br>
  All cost incurred with such a return will be invoiced to the customer unless otherwise agreed, i.e.:</br>
  </br>•	Transportation cost when shipping the goods back to SparMED (and if deemed out of warranty with no replacement or rectification of issue agreed, handling & return cost).
  </br>•	Taxes arising in regard to the order (e.g. if the customer is not an EU member).
  </br>•	Damage to goods that occur during transportation both from SparMED to customer/ customer to SparMED if no insurance was purchased. The sender must assume all responsibility for damages.
  </br>•	SparMED will not be responsible for units damaged in transit or shipped to the incorrect address.
  </br>•	SparMED will not accept COD (cash on delivery) or bill to receiver shipments. Inbound shipments must be prepaid by sender.
  </br>•	Discounted Products are non-returnable or refundable unless otherwise stated.</br>
  In the event that any order shipped by SparMED delivers any non-conforming goods, SparMED will, at its discretion implement one (or a combination) of the following option:
  </br>•	repair the nonconforming goods
  </br>•	provide a free replacement
  </br>•	grant you an appropriate credit note
  </br>•	offer a reduction in price if agreed upon</br>
  Any of these alternatives will be decided by SparMED in conjunction with the customer, however SparMED reserves the right to make the final decision. This shall be the sole and exclusive remedy in the event of delivery of non-conforming goods. SparMED shall not be liable to the customer or any other party for any other damages, directly or indirectly incurred.</br>
  If parcel is visibly destroyed, please take photos of the parcel before opening it. These photos will be needed as a proof of bad delivery and can be use for insurance claiming reasons, regardless if customer or SparMED will handle the complaint.
